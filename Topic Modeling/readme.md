# Topic Modeling Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs topic modeling on a given dataset. Topic modeling is a text mining technique used to discover the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents.

## File Overview

- **Topic Modeling.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and explanations for conducting topic modeling. The notebook includes the following steps:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Tokenization and vectorization
  - Topic modeling using techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
  - Visualization of the topics
  - Analysis and interpretation of the results

## Dependencies

To run the notebook successfully, you will need the following Python libraries installed in your environment:

- pandas
- gensim
- matplotlib
- nltk
- pyLDAvis

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas gensim matplotlib nltk pyLDAvis


3. **Run the cells**:

Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each cell. The notebook is designed to be run sequentially, from data loading to final analysis.

## Results

The notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the topics found in the dataset, including:

- A list of the most significant topics identified by the model.
- Visualizations that illustrate the topic distribution across the documents.
- Bar charts for each topic to give a better understanding of the most relevant words.
