# Data Description & Preprocessing

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks that detail the processes of data description, cleaning, and visualization for a dataset related to deepfake discussions on Reddit. The dataset has been carefully curated and prepared for analysis, with a focus on ensuring data quality and extracting meaningful insights.

## Files in this Folder

### 1. Data Preprocessing.ipynb
   - **Description**: This notebook contains the data cleaning procedures applied to the deepfake-related dataset. The cleaning process includes:
     - **Removing duplicates**: Ensuring that each record is unique.
     - **Handling missing values**: Addressing any gaps in the data fields, such as filling in missing values or removing incomplete records.
     - **Standardizing text data**: Cleaning and formatting the text data to remove inconsistencies, special characters, and unwanted whitespace.
     - **Date and time formatting**: Standardizing the datetime fields for consistency.
     - **Validating URLs**: Checking the correctness of URLs to ensure they link back to the appropriate Reddit posts or comments.
   - **Purpose**: The purpose of this notebook is to prepare the data for subsequent analysis by ensuring it is clean, consistent, and ready for use.

### 2. Data Distribution.ipynb
    - **Visualizing the distribution**: Create a bar chart to illustrate the distribution of sample quantities.
     - **Analyzing trends**: Identifying any notable trends or patterns in the data.
   - **Purpose**: The purpose of this notebook is to provide a visual and statistical overview of the data distribution, helping to identify patterns and insights that may inform further analysis.

### 3. Wordcloud.ipynb
   - **Description**: This notebook generates word clouds based on the textual content of the deepfake-related posts and comments. Key activities include:
     - **Text preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing the text data to prepare it for word cloud generation.
     - **Word cloud creation**: Visualizing the most common words and phrases used in the dataset, helping to identify key topics and themes.
   - **Purpose**: The purpose of this notebook is to provide a visual representation of the most frequently used words in the deepfake discussions, offering a quick insight into the common topics and sentiments expressed by Reddit users.
