# Sentiment Analysis Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs sentiment analysis on a given dataset. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text, which can be useful for understanding opinions, attitudes, and emotions expressed in text data.

## File Overview

- **Sentiment Analysis.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook includes the code and explanations for conducting sentiment analysis. The notebook covers the following steps:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Text cleaning and normalization
  - Feature extraction using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings
  - Sentiment classification
  - Visualization of sentiment distribution

## Dependencies

To run the notebook successfully, you will need the following Python libraries installed in your environment:

- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow or pytorch (depending on the model used)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow


3. **Run the cells**:

Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each cell. The notebook is designed to be run sequentially, from data loading to final analysis.

## Results

The notebook provides a detailed analysis of the sentiment in the dataset, including:

- Classification of text data into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- Visualizations, such as pie charts, word clouds, and sentiment distribution graphs..
